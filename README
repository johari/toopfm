ever wanted to find which tracks to listen to when someone named an artist?

when that happened, i fired up my proxy, waited a minute or so,
searched google for the artist name + last.fm,
and went to last.fm to see the top tracks.
it was hard, cumbersome and totaly not cool.

but now, things have changed..

also, if you prefer the command-line (i do), try this:
$ curl "<url-to-app>/txt/muse"

which spits a nice listing of the artist's top tracks.

have fun
